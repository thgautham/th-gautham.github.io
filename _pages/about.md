I like building things. I'm a Product Manager in the Financial Services industry where I use maths and data science for projects evolving to ML/AI solutions. 

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypothesis using monte-carlo simulation to predict particle flow and deposition concentration on computing server surfaces.

Currently, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and work on building prototypes.
