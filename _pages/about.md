I like building things. I'm a Product Manager in the Financial Services industry at Publicis Sapient, where I use maths and data science for projects evolving to ML/AI solutions. Mostly, I build prototypes either for financial models or build accelerator tools using python to solve all sorts of problems. Recently, I built a parsing tool that brings in asset information of local business establishments and the SFO airport for annual tax assessment for the local California County.

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypothesis using monte-carlo simulation to predict particle flow and deposition concentration on computing server surfaces. Before that, I worked as a Product analyst for Amazon India, Bangalore where we used math and statistics to find out the fraudulent transfers conducted on the mega-online e-platform. It was my first job and I'll always have a soft spot for picking up my first pay-check.

Currently, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and I have started to print 3-D miniature models.
